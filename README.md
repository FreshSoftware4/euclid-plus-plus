# Euclid++: Elements of Software
A highly ambitious but grounded and pragmatic proposal and initiative aimed at reshaping the very nature of software and software development.

It started with a simple request to my favorite brainless assistant:

> *Consider how single individuals tend to go through large swathes of different works and then create their own derivatives which unify them in a simpler and more powerful framework, as Euclid did with Euclid's Elements. Now, if one were to do likewise with programming languages (and certainly many have) what would be the most optimal best-of-all-worlds solution according to them? What features would it have, what syntax would it use, what methods of resource management would be in place, etc? Of course nothing of this sort has been implemented, but that's not to say it can't have been suggested, and for that reason seek out suggestions of that nature, from such people, and leverage your own reasoning abilities as well alongside this to arrive upon a definitive answer.*

The conversation that followed ignited in me a passion that drove me to further develop this idea with the companionship of our brainless oracle, which caused me to stumble upon various entirely new concepts, and to tread onwards in what is almost certainly the longest ChatGPT discussion I have had to date: https://chatgpt.com/share/68119570-0f2c-8001-a984-bb8327a09e03
